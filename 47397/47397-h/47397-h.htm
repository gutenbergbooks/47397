<p>Southward from the thirty-eighth
parallel of latitude the surface of
Western Utah descends in magnificent
&ldquo;Cyclopean steps&rdquo; from the flattened summits
of the Wasatch Mountains, 11,000
feet high, to 3,000 feet at the <i>Rio Virgen</i>,
then ascends gently in Arizona to the
colossal arch of the Kaibab Plateau, 9,000
feet in elevation and overlooking the
Grand Canyon. These Titanic terraces and
palisaded plateaus, more particularly the
flaming canyons and jeweled amphitheatres
cut from their color-saturated rock layers,
form scenic spectacles without peer or rival
on the globe. Nothing else is comparable
to these wonderlands. To see them is
both a thrilling adventure and an artistic
delight.</p>
<p>Measured by civilization&rsquo;s yardstick, the
unknown land in which they lie is a
frontier, still in the pioneer stage of existence.
It is not so long since the forts along
the way actually repelled Indian attacks;
it is not so far to fastnesses where cougars
come forth to prey on deer, or to desert
valleys where wild mustangs range. On
the edge of the plains are ruins of primitive
dwellings of which the modern Indian
knows nothing; in many a secluded canyon
are the more inscrutable habitations of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
cliff dwellers. The indomitable ranchers
have built quaint, poplar-shaded villages
with homes of adobe, and their farms are
often fenced with stone.</p>

<p>It is a mysterious land of purple sage and
empurpled distances, of incredible color,
of sun-magic and the wizardry of wind and
water. It is a place to drink in beauty, to
form new conceptions of the divine.</p>
<p>Geologists recognize three subdivisions
of the region from north to south: the High
Plateaus; the Terraced Plateaus; the Grand
Canyon Platform. From Cedar Breaks on
the High Plateau it is more than 100 miles
to Bright Angel Point on Grand Canyon&rsquo;s
rim; from Hurricane Ledge on the west,
eastward to the Colorado River is more
than 100 miles.</p>
<p>The country reveals fascinating chapters
of geologic history. It is a region that has
undergone great transitions, alternately
sea bottom and mountain top; a region
broken and tilted by tremendous displacements;
a region scorched and branded by
intense volcanic action; but more than all
else, from the viewpoint of human interest,
a region profoundly sculptured and given
its most distinctive character by the beauty-creating
genius of erosion.</p>
<p>From Cedar Breaks, cut into mountains
11,000 feet high, the vision has a sweep
of 100 miles, and the vast terraces may be
seen thrust out to the south like promontories
into the sea. Where one succeeds
another, the uppermost presents sinuous
cliff walls, hundreds of miles in length and
superbly distinctive in color and carving.
More than 10,000 feet of strata are exposed,
&ldquo;a library of the ages in vivid bindings&rdquo;
that contains the fossil remains of creatures
since the morning of life on earth. Each
step down indicates the removal, by streams,
rain, frost and wind, of all the rock-layers
above it. From the Grand Canyon Platform,
these 10,000 feet of strata have been

<p>The highest of the Terraced Plateaus,
the Markagunt and Paunsaugunt, in which
Cedar Breaks and Bryce Canyon lie, break
down in spired palisades of the Pink Cliffs,
endless in sculptured variety. Beneath the
Markagunt the southern scarps of the
Kolob Plateau, into which flaming Zion
Canyon is sunk, form noble cliffs of pure,
reposeful white. The next step downward
displays the glowing Vermilion Cliffs, castellated
with ornate prodigality and perhaps
the grandest of all. Lower still are
the Shinarump Cliffs, banded with reds,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
browns, yellows, greens and purples.
Between them and the Kaibab lies a stretch
of desert like a flattened rainbow. Such is
the strange, magnificent and colorful structure
of the land.</p>

<p>Zion Canyon is a profound gorge with
the colors of blood, fire and snow, a matchless
carving by the greatest of all sculptors,
erosion. Several of its mighty rock temples
rank with the most majestic masses in
the land. The variety of its endless etchings,
the exquisite harmonies of its painted
precipices, the sustained grandeur of its
stupendous buttes and walls, its glorious
cycle of color from dawn to sunset are
sources of undimmed delight to the artistic
instinct within everyone. It has one aspect
of beauty from its green-garbed floor,
another from its dizzy rim of white; from
the dusky depths of the Narrows the
dominant sensation is soul-gripping awe.</p>
<p>Zion National Park includes other canyons
of extraordinary interest, and the
entire terrace-top of the broad Kolob Plateau
is a domain of incredibly fantastic
formations.</p>
<p>Cedar Breaks, the highest of Utah&rsquo;s
jeweled amphitheatres, is a place of wild
and lofty beauty, a series of vast sculptured
basins sunk into the summits of the
mountains. Endless outflung bastions and
buttresses, supporting towers, parapets and
craggy spires, parade from the rim down
into the painted abyss where, dotted by
the green of pines, red, orange, yellow,
purple and white are banded and splashed
in a symphony of color literally unbelievable
till the eyes confirm.</p>
<p>Bryce Canyon also is an amphitheatre,
a richer, more compacted bit of resplendence.
You hardly believe that Bryce
Canyon exists until you have gazed many
times; so amazing is its beauty that it
seems like the flashing vision of a dream.
It is something heretofore unknown and unsuspected
in scenery&mdash;a miracle of erosion,
a peerless fantasy of color. From its depths,
in pairs, in groups, in clusters, in hosts and
in myriads, leap to the eyes the most amazingly
bizarre forms, slender, dainty, bulky,
grotesque&mdash;a bewildering combination of
heaven and hell in which the angelic
easily predominates. These myriad forms,
human, animal and geometrical, lighted
with unearthly radiance, seem to dance
from their celestial castles and gorgeous
grottoes to meet the beholder. Bryce contains
all that architecture, all that sculpture
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
knows, in one great glory hole painted
pink, red, white, orange and purple.</p>

<p>What magic the morning and the evening
sun performs on the pigmented palisades
of this unique land! A dull rust red
a moment ago, that distant peristyle now
glows like fiery embers; the whites are
more dazzlingly white and caressingly soft;
the orange tones are enriched; the purple
shadows swarm like birds. Colors flit
mysteriously from salient to salient as if
some one back stage were focusing spotlights.
Dormant, crouching bulks rise,
stretch and add to their girths, decking
themselves in their most splendid raiment
to bid farewell to the master of ceremonies,
the vivifying sun.</p>
<p>Farther to the south is the Kaibab Forest
and the North Rim of Grand Canyon,
remote from traveled ways. Kaibab
National Forest is the largest and most
beautiful virgin forest in the United States.
Beneath the stately pines, spruces and firs,
the grassy forest floor is as clean as a carefully
groomed lawn, and there are many
open parks, aspen encircled, of bewitching
charm. Numberless deer roam unmolested
through this fairy forest and the rare
white-tailed squirrel flits ghostlike through
its aisles. There Roosevelt hunted and
discriminating beauty-lovers have sought
the region for years.</p>
<p>Words are of little avail to describe the
Grand Canyon. Across the great plateau
the Colorado River has cut a series of
canyons about 220 miles long, a mile in
depth and twelve miles in width. The
Kaibab division is the deepest and wildest
part of the Grand Canyon and presents its
sublimest scenes. On the North Rim are
some of the most celebrated of all the viewpoints,
though known only to a few
hundred adventurous travelers&mdash;Bright
Angel Point, Point Sublime, Point Imperial,
Cape Final and Cape Royal.</p>
<p>The way is now prepared for you to see
these miracle places of America in comfort.</p>

<h3 class="generic">Cedar City to Zion National Park</h3>
<p>The highway southward from Cedar
City (the Zion Park Highway) is on the
floor of an arm of prehistoric Lake Bonneville.
This is the Great Basin region, a
sort of prison for running water because
none of its streams ever reach the sea. In
the east are the steep scarps of the Markagunt
and Kolob Plateaus limited by a tremendous
fault plane, the Hurricane Ledge;
in the west are the Iron Mountains, veritable
masses of iron ore; in the south are
the lofty, majestic Pine Valley Mountains,
extinct volcanoes whose dark, wrinkled
summits exceed 10,000 feet in elevation.</p>
<p>Hamilton&rsquo;s Fort, a few miles from Cedar
City, was once a frontier outpost, the
scene of several battles with Indians. Near
the village of Kanarra the route passes over
the rim of the Great Basin and enters
the Colorado River watershed. Here
Hurricane Ledge lifts more sharply into
prominence, a precipitous rampart of gray
and red rock mottled by pi&ntilde;ons and junipers.
The surface on which the road lies is the
same as that on top of the ledge; the land
in the valley either dropped hundreds of
feet or the plateau was upthrust an equal
distance. Hurricane Fault, as geologists
call it, is the most striking displacement
in the West. It extends from the volcanic
Tushar Mountains, north of Cedar City,
along the base of the Markagunt Plateau
and southward across the Grand Canyon,
a total distance of more than 200 miles.</p>

<p>The road now follows Ash Creek, a
tributary of the Virgin, over lava flows
where prickly pears, pin-cushion cacti,
yucca, torchweed and miner&rsquo;s candlesticks
grow among the sage brush. Thereabouts
the first view is had of the Valley of the
Virgin, Utah&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dixie,&rdquo; a tumbled region
of low mesas, black volcanic cones, lava
fields and dunes of cherry-red sand, settled
by Mormon colonists in 1858. This &ldquo;Dixie&rdquo;
section of Utah, about 3,000 feet in elevation,
is sub-tropical in climate, grows
a large variety of agricultural products
including cotton and tobacco, and its
poplar-shaded villages have a quaintness
suggestive of foreign lands. One of the
most picturesque communities is Toquerville,
named after an Indian chief, and
where the automobiles stop so that the
traveler may purchase for small sums an
amazing variety of delicious fruit: figs,
pomegranates, grapes, melons, almonds,
peaches, pears, plums and apricots. Along
the village street, with its double row of
poplars planted as windbreaks, are odd
houses of adobe fenced with stone, seemingly
asleep beneath their luxuriant fig
trees; irrigation streams gurgle and sing
with the cool seduction of flowing water
in an arid land. The scene has a pastoral
air of Biblical peace and plenty. Three
miles south, the Harding Highway crosses
La Verkin Creek, turns eastward, and
begins to climb.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><i>The Three Patriarchs, Zion National Park</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>In an instant the scene changes completely.
Long, buttressed and fretted mesa
promontories parade solemnly into view,
an endless array of marching mountains
banded with buff, red, pink and gray,
mountains that seem to have come from
nowhere. Soon arises across the gray-green
sage the huge rock cathedral called Smithsonian
Butte, spired with silver and gray;
and then, instantaneously dominating the
entire landscape, there appears, at the gates
of Zion, the West Temple of the Virgin.
The transcendent beauty of this tremendous
tinted temple of stone is best realized when
irradiated by the morning or afternoon
sun. The southern facade of the structure
forms a sundial for the villages near by.
The finest description is that of Captain
C. E. Dutton, a celebrated geologist who,
while in the service of the government,
wrote in 1880:</p>
<h4>Captain Dutton&rsquo;s Description of the West Temple and the Gates of Zion</h4>
<p class="center">(<i>Somewhat Abridged</i>)</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an hour&rsquo;s time, we reached the crest
of the isthmus, and in an instant there
flashed before us a scene never to be forgotten.
In coming time it will, I believe,
take rank with a very small number of
spectacles each of which will, in its own
way, be regarded as the most exquisite of
its kind which the world discloses.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Across the canyon stands the central
and commanding object of the picture, the
Western Temple, rising 4,000 feet above
the river. Its glorious summit was the
object we had seen an hour before, and now
the matchless beauty and majesty of its
vast mass is all before us. Yet it is only
the central object of a mighty throng of
structures wrought up to the same exalted
style and filling up the entire panorama.
Right opposite us are the two principal
forks of the Virgin, the Parunuweap coming
from the east, and the Mukuntuweap,
or Little Zion Valley, descending from the
north. The Parunuweap is seen emerging
through a stupendous gateway and chasm
nearly 3,000 feet in depth. The further
wall of this canyon swings northward and
becomes the eastern wall of Little Zion
Valley. As it sweeps down the Parunuweap,
it breaks into great pediments covered
all over with the richest carving. The
effect is much like that which the architect
of the Milan Cathedral appears to
have designed, though here it is vividly
suggested rather than fully realized. The
sumptuous, bewildering, mazy effect is all
there, but when we attempt to analyze it
in detail it eludes us.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p011.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="315" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><i>Distant View of the West Temple of the Virgin, Zion National Park</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The flank of the wall receding up the
Mukuntuweap is for a mile or two similarly
decorated, but soon breaks into new forms
much more impressive and wonderful. A
row of towers half a mile high is quarried
out of the palisade and stands well advanced
from its face. There is an eloquence to
their forms which stirs the imagination
with singular power and kindles in the
mind of the dullest observer a glowing
response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Directly in front of us a complex group
of white towers, springing from a central
pile, mounts upward to the clouds. Out
of their midst, and high over all, rises a
dome-like mass which dominates the entire
landscape. It is almost pure white, with
brilliant streaks of carmine descending its
vertical walls. At the summit it is truncated
and a flat tablet is laid upon the top,
showing its edge of deep red. It is impossible
to liken this object to any familiar
shape, for it resembles none. Yet its shape
is far from being indefinite; on the contrary
it has definiteness and individuality which
extort an exclamation of surprise when first
beheld. Call it a dome; not because it has
the ordinary shape of such a structure but
because it performs the functions of a dome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The towers which surround it are of
inferior mass and altitude, but each is a
study of fine form and architectural effect.
They are white above and change to rich
red below. Dome and towers are planted
upon a substructure no less admirable. A
curtain wall 1,400 feet high descends vertically
from the eaves of the temples and
is succeeded by a steep slope of ever-widening
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
base-courses leading down to the
esplanade below. The curtain wall is
decorated with a lavish display of vertical
mouldings, and the ridges, eaves and mitred
angles are fretted with serrated cusps.
This ornamentation is repetitive, not symmetrical.
But though exact symmetry is
wanting, Nature has here brought home to
us the truth that symmetry is only one of
an infinite range of devices by which
beauty can be realized.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>And finer forms are in the quarry</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Than ever Angelo evoked!</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing can exceed the wondrous
beauty of Little Zion Valley, which separates
the two temples and their respective
groups of towers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the traveler has not yet reached the
gates of Zion, although distant views
continue to appear and disappear. The
Virgin River is now near at hand on the
right, a swift, moody, meandering stream
whose red waters are the creators of the
fertile farms along its banks and sometimes
their destroyers. The foreground
landscape is red, although the broad, sloping
buttresses of the mesas, folded, fluted
and flounced <i>ad infinitum</i>, display buffs,
yellows, grays, browns and purples.</p>

</div>
<p>Near Virgin City there is a view northeastward
of sensational Guardian Angel
Pass. Across Great West Canyon, apparently,
stands an immense dam of rock cleft
by a rectangular aperture as regular as if cut
by engineers; surmounting the barrier are
two towering white cones, the ghostly
guardians of the gap. Another fascinating
feature of the panorama is the complex convergence
of the battlemented mesa promontories
from all directions except the south;
these carved and tinted headlands actually
seem to advance upon the beholder. In
the east are the pinnacled spires of the
Eagle Crags, shattered to dagger sharpness.</p>
<p>Rockville, another village beside the
Virgin, was founded by Mormon pioneers
in 1861, and was long an important telegraph
station. There is a petrified forest
in the vicinity.</p>
<p>About five miles beyond, the two profound
chasms, the Mukuntuweap (Zion)
and the Parunuweap, converge; and the two
sublime domes, the East and West Temples,
with their incredible crests of crimson
bleeding down their pale precipices, soar
above the rushing waters. Springdale, the
last Mormon hamlet, is passed; then the
Ranger Station at the southern boundary
of Zion National Park.</p>

<h2 id="c2">Zion National Park</h2>
<h3 class="generic">Legend and History</h3>
<p>Zion National Park is a roughly quadrangular
area of approximately 120 square
miles, sixty-four miles by highway from
Cedar City, and sixty miles on an air line
north of the rim of Grand Canyon. It
was set apart as a National Monument
under its Indian name, <i>Mukuntuweap</i>, in
1909. In 1919 its area was enlarged, its
name was changed to that given it by the
Mormon pioneers, and it was made a
National Park.</p>
<p>There are cliff dwelling ruins in Zion
Canyon, more in Parunuweap Canyon, and
the modern Indians had a reverent acquaintance
with its solemn amphitheatres. Several
interpretations are given of its Indian
name, <i>Mukuntuweap</i>. Major Powell
translated it &ldquo;straight canyon;&rdquo; another
interpretation is &ldquo;place of many waters;&rdquo;
still another is &ldquo;place of the gods.&rdquo; One
legend declares that the Paru-sha-pats
Indians once saw a light upon the West
Temple and supposed it to be a signal fire
to warn them of a Navajo raid. But they
found that the West Temple is unscalable
and decided that friendly rock spirits had
produced a supernatural incandescence; and
so, to them, it was &ldquo;Rock-rover&rsquo;s Land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is certain that the Indians regarded
Zion Canyon as a place sacred to spiritual
beings; they laid their propitiatory offerings
of flesh and fruit at the foot of the
crimson crags of Sinawava and none would
spend a night in their shadows.</p>
<p>Mormon colonists entered the region
about 1858, began its patient reclamation
by irrigation, and named the marvelous
canyon Little Zion. Major Powell, the
famous explorer-geologist reconnoitered
the country in 1870. A few years later
Captain Dutton studied it and in &ldquo;The
Tertiary History of the Grand Canyon
District,&rdquo; now out of print, presented a
picture that is &ldquo;a classic of inspired description.&rdquo;
From that time until 1909,
except for the visits of a few artists and
travelers of the adventurous type, Zion
was practically unknown. It may now be
visited in perfect comfort. Several colleges
have sent classes there for summer study.</p>

<h3 class="generic">Description</h3>
<p>The outstanding feature of Zion National
Park is Zion Canyon, the stupendous red
and white gorge cut by the Mukuntuweap
River from the Kolob Plateau through
more than 3,000 feet of the Jurassic sandstones
of the White and Vermilion cliffs
and down into lower beds of mauve sandstone
and shales of purple and red. The
floor of Zion is 4,100 feet above sea level;
the dome of the West Temple rises to 7,650
feet. The canyon is about fourteen miles
long and varies in width from about a mile
at Springdale to scarcely more than the
reach of a man&rsquo;s outstretched hands in the
upper Narrows where the river has cut
a channel under the towering cliffs. Imagine,
if you can, the overwhelming effect
of these painted precipices, nearly 2,000
feet high and both close enough to be
touched without moving.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p016.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="315" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><i>The Temples of Zion</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>In places the canyon widens into courts
and shrines of bewitching beauty, such as
the Court of the Patriarchs and the Temple
of Sinawava. From the vermilion walls
have been chiseled individual buttes and
peaks of monstrous greatness and surpassing
majesty, among them Angels Landing,
the Great White Throne and the Mountain
of Mystery. And these soaring scarps and
summits present such varied tints and hues
of red that the expert in pigments is
bewildered; from the delicate pink of a
baby&rsquo;s cheek to deepest carmine, and
beyond&mdash;from bittersweet and orient pink
through orange chrome, flame-scarlet,
vermilion, jasper, Pompeiian red and Indian
lake to mahogany, ox-blood, maroon and
a red that is almost black. In places the
walls are topped with creamy white and
the green of pines. Everywhere they
exhibit a wizardry of massive sculpture.
The deep-set river is bordered with the
verdure of cottonwoods, box-elders, pines,
ferns and flowering shrubs; in mossy caves
curtained by little waterfalls, deer cradle
their fawns. The radiance of the morning
and evening sun upon the tinted towers of
Zion is among the finest of its spectacles.</p>
<p>Standing upon the edge of the Park near
Springdale is The Watchman, a stately
cathedral-like pile of red sandstone. About
a mile beyond is Bridge Mountain upon
whose upper slope may be discerned a great
bow of stone, a natural bridge with a span
of 100 feet. Among the Towers of the
Virgin stands the Altar of Sacrifice, a
buttressed white fane whose summit and
wall are stained deep with flowing crimson,
suggesting the bloody sacrificial place
of some insatiable pagan god. The East
Temple, on the right, is a splendid structure
of pink and white surmounted by a
carmine capstone.</p>
<p>On the left is the Streaked Wall bearing
strange white cones, and beyond it is
Sentinel Peak. The west wall then recedes
to form the fine Court of the Patriarchs
whence rise the three stately Patriarchs
themselves, jagged pink and white
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
pyramids. Above the east wall stand the
Twin Brothers and the Mountain-of-the-Sun,
the latter the first to glow in the
light of dawn, the last to hold the evening
rays. Lady Mountain, Mt. Majestic and
Red Arch Mountain next appear, and
Angels Landing, a sharp-shorn, pyramidal
wedge of Pompeiian red that projects
boldly into the canyon and throws off
from its foot a fluted ox-blood mass called
the Great Organ. Round this the river
winds in a serpentine semicircle.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><i>On the West Rim, Zion National Park</i></span></p>
</div>
<h4>The Great White Throne</h4>
<p>Just below the great bend in the Mukuntuweap
River looms an isolated rock temple
of prodigious bulk and imperial majesty, a
truncated pyramid or mayhap a flattened
dome, its lower half red, its upper
half tinting from rosy buff to white, a
forest of tall pines, acres in extent, upon
its untrodden summit. This colossal butte,
&ldquo;one of the world&rsquo;s great rocks,&rdquo; is seen
most effectively from the Temple of Sinawava,
through the inverted maroon arch
between the Great Organ and Angels
Landing. It appears completely detached
from the east wall, aloof and unscalable.
While it has not been officially measured,
its crest is probably more than 3,000 feet
above the river.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/p018.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="632" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><i>In the Narrows, Zion National Park</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>To the north is Cable Mountain, whence
a rope of steel wire conveys lumber to the
valley from the forested plateau. Between
it and the next peak is Raining Cave and
the site of a cliff dwelling.</p>
<h4>The Temple of Sinawava</h4>
<p>Beyond the bend the precipices of jasper
red confine a flower-dotted meadow shaded
by trees, where sphinx-like figures, colossi,
and shattered pylons of warm and sombre
reds suggest the Egyptian ruins at Karnak
and Thebes. Several obelisks rise isolated
from the gardens of the shrine. This is
the beautiful Temple of Sinawava, the last
of the courts as one ascends the Canyon.
It was here that President Harding paid
his tribute to Zion in 1923.</p>
<h4>The Narrows</h4>
<p>Half a mile beyond, the dragon&rsquo;s-blood
precipices become more perpendicular and
close in toward each other until the gorge
seems blocked, but a turn opens new vistas.
Now, it is no more than seventy-five feet
from cliff to cliff and the stream stretches
from wall to wall. But there is one last
glorious picture for those who must turn
back. A short distance farther up the gorge
soars a slender, ethereal cone of pink and
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
white, a peak of such appealing symmetry
and delicate tints, so lofty and aspiring,
that it evokes a cry of admiration. It is the
Mountain of Mystery.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><i>One of the Amphitheatres of Cedar Breaks</i></span></p>
</div>
<h4>The Wet Trail</h4>
<p>The Canyon continues some eight miles
farther, but its exploration is only for the
adventurous few. There is no trail but the
winding river which reaches from wall to
wall; sudden rainstorms send between the
scarred and splintered cliffs a resistless
torrent of water. With a competent guide
those in search of unusual thrills may ride
horseback several miles into the deep
sunless cleft where great pendants of rock
overhang and shut out the sky; where the
churning stream in flood has left intricate
cameos and arabesques upon the sandstone;
where little waterfalls leap from green
ledges; where one may almost touch both
sombre walls with outstretched hands;
where the stars may be seen by day. Many
a time the canyon seems to end with prison-like
finality and the sky seems lost forever.
It is a travel adventure that may not be
had elsewhere and one never forgotten.</p>
<h4>Zion from the Rims</h4>
<p>Seen from above, the aspect of Zion is
wholly different. Instead of a relatively
straight and orderly canyon dominantly
red in color, it becomes a fantastic maze of
white and variegated buttes and cones.
Mr. Hal G. Evarts thus described in <i>The
Saturday Evening Post</i> his impressions from
the West Rim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed that we gazed out across
some vast oriental city that stretched away
for a dozen miles. Scores of gaudy mosques
and tinted towers, striped citadels topped
by flat-roof gardens rose in countless tiers
from this congested, painted metropolis....
And the coloring! Imagine a tremendous
city of spires and turrets ...,
its buildings catching every dazzling reflection
of the sunset.... There were
soft apricot and salmon tints, vague pinks
and creams; lemon blending into deepest

suggestion of pale mauve. Brilliant red

<h3 class="generic">Cedar City to Cedar Breaks</h3>
<p>Cedar Breaks is twenty-three miles by
highway east of Cedar City and four-fifths
of a mile nearer the sky. Immediately east
of the town the road enters the rugged
gorge of Coal Creek, its slopes covered
with fine forests of conifers and aspens.
The walls assume impressive castellated
forms that are especially striking at the
mouth of Ashdown Gorge, eight miles
distant. Ashdown Gorge is an extremely
narrow, tortuous and precipitous rift in
the plateau, down which rushes a sparkling
stream from the vast furrows of Cedar
Breaks. About one mile from the mouth
and high up the precipice is a natural
bridge with an arch of about sixty feet and
a span of about seventy feet.</p>
<p>Following Coal Creek, ever upward, the
road presently occupies a shelf upon the
shoulder of the Markagunt Plateau whence
are revealed glorious and almost illimitable
panoramas. The whole sweep of the
Terraced Plateau country to the south is
visible. Some twenty-five miles directly
south, slashed into the green of the Kolob
Plateau, are the mazy, white-topped temples
and towers of Zion, the grand West
Temple dominating the scene. The sinuous
profiles of the Pink, White and Vermilion
Cliffs are discernible; the hazy arch of the
Kaibab; and the misty dome of Navajo
Mountain, beyond the Colorado. Several
volcanic peaks are in the foreground.</p>
<p>This immense range of visibility is one
of the strong attractions of the Terraced
Plateau country; one sees again and again,
in new and startling aspects, the salient
features of hundreds of square miles of
territory and its spectacular geological
structure.</p>
<p>At Midway the road turns northward
for three miles through stately pines, firs
and spruces and comes without warning to
the abyss named Cedar Breaks.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><i>Cedar Breaks</i></span></p>
</div>
<h2 id="c3">Cedar Breaks</h2>
<p>Cedar Breaks is a series of vast amphitheatres
eroded to a depth of 2,000 feet into
the Pink Cliff formation at the summit of
the Markagunt Plateau and covering an
area of approximately sixty square miles
in the Sevier National Forest. Its forested
rim, 10,300 feet in elevation, has been
etched back into Blowhard Mountain and
adjacent eminences; and a short distance
to the north the blunted volcanic crest of
Brian Head rises 900 feet higher, affording
a panorama of practically all of southern
Utah, Nevada and northern Arizona.</p>
<p>Within its limitless labyrinths countless
millions of grotesque and magnificent architectural
forms, anointed with all the
colors of the spectrum, flash into the eyes
of the beholder. The erosional structures
are blends of Egyptian and massive medieval
Gothic walls, modified in a thousand
surprising and original details, and rising
generally from far-flung, wedge-shaped
base courses of white and orange. The
colors change marvelously in response to
the sun; pink is dominant, though, at
times, orange tones seem to prevail. In
broad aspect the color scheme is pink, red,
orange, yellow, white, lavender and purple,
with intermediate tints and hues that
would form a dictionary of pigments; and
on the countless scalloped slopes appears
the green of spruces, firs and pines. An
artist has counted more than sixty tints in
Cedar Breaks.</p>
<p>There are six or seven great amphitheatres,
semicircular or three-quarter
circles in shape, with sharp ridges radiating
from rim to center; the few trails into
the abysmal serrate basins are faint and
obscure, yet the descent with a guide
offers unsuspected marvels; then only does
one comprehend the immensity and the
variety of Cedar Breaks.</p>
<p>Along the rims are several easily reached
viewpoints, among them Point Supreme
and Point Perfection. Conspicuous in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
welter of forms below are innumerable red,
castellated bastions in parallel rows; long,
writhing dragon-like forms of pure white;
and huge sprawling dinosaurs covered with
blood. For all its beauty, the place might
appropriately have been the habitat of prehistoric
monsters. The panoramas westward
across the deserts of the Great Basin
are notably fine.</p>

<p>In vastness, in variety of color, in wild
grandeur, Cedar Breaks is the greatest of
Utah&rsquo;s painted amphitheatres.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Cedar Breaks to Bryce Canyon</h3>
<p>It is seventy miles from Cedar Breaks to
Bryce Canyon. Crossing the broad summit
of the Markagunt Plateau the highway
traverses fine coniferous forests that frequently
open into charming &ldquo;parks,&rdquo; and
passes great areas covered with lava from
Hancock Peak and the adjacent extinct
volcanoes. Navajo Lake, a beautiful
mountain tarn encircled by pines and a
noted fishing water, is about eight miles
beyond Midway.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><i>One of the Countless Castles of Bryce Canyon</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>Soon pretty Duck Creek, rising in full
power from a fine spring and filled with
trout, parallels the highway for several
miles, then disappears under the volcanic
rock. At the crossing of Strawberry Gulch
a little used trail extends southward to
Strawberry Point, a famous observation
place on the Pink Cliffs. The main highway
is alternately surfaced with white,
pink and red rock, a painted road in a land
of color.</p>
<p>At Cedar Breaks Junction, the route turns
north, following the head waters of the
Sevier River, one of the most important
streams of the Great Basin; to the eastward,
in the vicinity of Hatch, vistas of the Pink
Cliffs appear. Then the road crosses the
Sevier and enters Red Canyon.</p>
<p>The rich red turrets and towers at this
canyon gateway are harmonious introductions
to the greater glories of Bryce. Once
within its narrow defile, the superb portal
broadens into a little pine-dotted valley
and its walls display hundreds of spires,
windowed walls, bridges, columns and
statue-like shapes of pink and ruby. The
road, often running through arches in the
red cliffs, is as smooth as a boulevard.
Next, the route leads out upon the level,
treeless surface of the Paunsaugunt Plateau,
and comes with startling unexpectedness
to one of the splendid amphitheatres of
the Pahreah Basin.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="c4">Bryce Canyon National Monument</h2>
<p>Probably Bryce Canyon is the most
astonishing blend of exquisite beauty and
grotesque grandeur that the forces of erosion
have ever produced. In one aspect it
is a gorgeous lacework design of frost and
fire, the playground of sylphs and fairies; in
another it is a smoldering inferno habited
by goblins and demons; again, it seems as
if some cataclysmic force had shuffled together
a dozen oriental cities into one
spectacular municipality. The joyous prevailing
colors of this immense bowl of
luminous, flickering filigree heaped with
jewels, are pink, red, orange, purple, yellow
and white; to these may be added as many
other tints and tones as one has patience to
distinguish. Though Bryce is immense, yet
it is intimate, presenting to the eye a
scintillating coral intaglio of bizarre but
definite plan, overspread with a halo of
lavender mist.</p>
<p>It is not a canyon, but an amphitheatre
of horseshoe shape, graven 1,000 feet deep
into the sandstones on the eastern edge of
the Paunsaugunt Plateau, at the headwaters
of the Pahreah River; it is approximately
two miles wide and three miles long and its
rim is 8,000 feet in elevation. The area
of Bryce Canyon National Monument,
which was created in 1923 and is administered
by the <i>U. S. Department of
Agriculture</i>, is 7,440 acres.</p>
<p>In the maze of architecture uprising from
Bryce&rsquo;s sunken gardens, where pine, spruce
and manzanita spread their greens, there
are the styles of China and Egypt, of the
Toltecs, Incas, Greeks and Goths;
but stronger, perhaps, is the resemblance to
those decaying Dravidian temples, bursting
with decoration, in the jungles of Burmah
and Java: pagodas, mosques, minarets,
kiosks, fairy castles, cathedrals, theatres,
flying buttresses and stairways, suspension
bridges, niched and fenestrated walls, peristyles,
colonnades, lotus columns, leaning
towers, slim spires, massive pylons, pyramids,
obelisks, pilasters capped by tilted
disks, cones supporting cones, organs,
shrines and altars. All of the architects of
antiquity might have drawn their inspiration
from the silent cities of Bryce.</p>
<p>And these dream-tissue cities in the
realm of muted mystery have weird
inhabitants statued in variegated stone:
giants and gnomes, popes and queens,
kneeling penitents, companies of marching
soldiers, gargoyles, fauns, satyrs,
nymphs, witches, horses, dogs, lizards,
frogs and turtles&mdash;figures that seem to
move, sway and posture in the flashing
play of light and shadow. The least vivid
imagination needs a checkrein.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><i>The Cathedral, Bryce Canyon</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>In the east, on a headland of the Table
Cliffs, an outlier of the vast Aquarius
Plateau, the mesa rises by ramps and colonnades
of pink and buff to a level esplanade
where stand a dozen glorified Acropolises,&mdash;fa&ccedil;ades,
friezes, pillars and porticoes, in
ruins of rosy marble. There, as everywhere,
the marionettes of the sun continually
perform their evanescent dances. And
this is but a vista chosen at random from a
hundred glorious panoramas.</p>
<p>Farther in the east, the amphitheatre
opens out to make way for the headstreams
of the Pahreah River; the green fields surrounding
the village of Tropic may be seen
and the ramparts of the Kaiparowitz
Plateau.</p>
<p>Bryce should be seen from the west rim
in the morning, from the east rim in the
afternoon. The exquisite pageant of shimmering
tints begins when dawn thrusts the
first spears of light into the abysses. The
best effects are obtained when the formations
are between the beholder and the sun;
it is then that the mysterious, lambent
flames flicker in the distant temples and
play upon altars and columns, warming
them into living, glowing color. Trails
extend in both directions along the rim of
the Canyon from Bryce Lodge and the
vistas change with almost every step taken.</p>
<p>Sunset upon Bryce Canyon is another
breath-taking manifestation of Nature&rsquo;s
magic, followed by a solemn twilight of
the innumerable gods that dwell there in
pomp and splendor. The visitor should
see both dawn and dusk transform the
great amphitheatre, and should see it
sleeping in the noonday light.</p>
<p>Every visitor should take the trail into
the depths of Bryce Canyon, either on foot
or horseback. Lacy designs and dainty
figures, seen from the rim, assume huge
proportions when one is amongst them;
there are sunless grottoes and shadowed
crypts, wafer walls pierced by many windows,
artists&rsquo; studios filled with half-finished
models and figurines, innumerable
fantastic forms in bronze, jasper, ruby
amethyst, topaz and alabaster. Each turn
in every innumerable aisle, alley and
corridor on Bryce&rsquo;s intricate floor has its
charming revelations of unimagined contour
and color.</p>

<h3 class="generic">Zion Canyon to Kaibab Forest and North Rim of Grand Canyon</h3>
<p>The highway crosses the <i>Rio Virgen</i> at
Rockville and climbs the plateau, whence
splendid views may be had of the Temples
of Zion. Near the Arizona boundary appear
the magnificent Vermilion Cliffs which
stretch across Southern Utah for great
distances; they present the arresting architectural
effects of vast castles and cathedrals
colored rich red which becomes vivid
vermilion in the afternoon sun.</p>
<p>After crossing Short Creek into Arizona
the immense blue arch of the Kaibab Plateau
becomes more prominent and Mt. Trumbull,
an extinct volcano overlooking Grand
Canyon, looms in the purple distance. Upon
this stretch of fascinating desert range many
wild horses, direct descendants, perhaps, of
those brought to America by the Spaniards.
On Cedar Ridge is a petrified forest.</p>
<p>The road follows the Vermilion Cliffs
eastward through the Kaibab Indian Reservation
to Pipe Spring, a celebrated oasis on
the plains, created a National Monument
in 1923. The two historic stone buildings
standing there were erected more than fifty
years ago in fortress style for protection
from the Indians; from beneath one house
flows the finest and purest spring in all
this frontier domain, daily discharging
100,000 gallons of cool water.</p>
<p>At Pipe Spring, the Vermilion Cliffs recede
northward and give place to the Shinarump
Cliffs, banded with gorgeous colors&mdash;red,
brown, lavender, chocolate and white. A
conspicuous butte seen approaching Fredonia
is The Battleship. Fredonia is a
pretty little Mormon community of 300
inhabitants and the only town in Arizona
north of the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>Between Fredonia and the Kaibab is one
of the most picturesque and exquisitely
colored stretches of upland in America.
Whites, blacks, browns, yellows, pinks,
purples, reds and all their pale intermediate
tints are splashed over these prismatic
plains, where cactus, yucca, pi&ntilde;on, sage
and cedar somehow find sustenance.</p>
<p>Almost imperceptibly, the automobile
has climbed the gentle slopes of the Kaibab.
Looking backward to the north one of
the grandest spectacles of the Plateau
Country is unfolded. Nearly 10,000 feet of
terraced rock layers are exposed edgewise
across a frontage of some sixty miles. A
glorious panorama, these painted precipices!
First the rainbow Shinarump, then
the Vermilion, White and Pink cliffs, tier
upon tier and hundreds of miles in convoluted
length, all shining and shifting in
the sun.</p>

<h2 id="c5">Kaibab National Forest</h2>
<p>Beautiful as are the plains, the transition
to the limitless park-like forests of the
Kaibab is a welcome delight. Kaibab is a
Piute Indian word meaning &ldquo;Mountain-lying-down,&rdquo;
a description that fits it
well. It is actually a vast plateau,
some fifty miles long and thirty-five miles
wide, and containing 500 square miles of
yellow pine, fir and spruce diversified by
charming aspen copses, the largest and
most beautiful virgin forest in the United
States. In elevation it rises from 7,500 to
9,300 feet above sea level.</p>
<p>Kaibab Forest occupies the top of a lofty
plateau isolated on the south and east by
the Grand Canyon, on the north and west
by the mysterious plains above which it
rises 5,000 feet. On all sides are unexplored
plateaus and canyons where untouched cliff
dwellings stand. Beneath its stately trees
the grassy forest floor is free from underbrush
and fallen timber, as clean as if raked
daily by ten thousand foresters; and, although
they are not widely distributed,
there are many lovely wild flowers and ferns.
Scattered throughout its great extent are
spacious &ldquo;parks,&rdquo; green-swarded, treeless
open spaces bordered by white-boled, quivering
aspens, the advancing light cavalry of
an innumerable army of deploying pines.
The witchery of these sylvan plaisances
is wholly irresistible; they seem designed
for parades and pageants, for the light-hearted
moods of man and beast.</p>
<p>And so, indeed, they are employed.
Afternoon and morning they are the gathering
places of many of the 30,000 black-tail
mule deer that range unfrightened through
the forest. They do not require patient
stalking to be seen; crossing the forest one
may usually count several hundred haughty
bucks, solicitous does, and adorable prancing
fawns of exquisite grace. Their only
enemies are the cougars, much reduced in
number by &ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; Jimmy Owens, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
government hunter who was Roosevelt&rsquo;s
guide, and other official huntsmen. Second
in interest of the Kaibab&rsquo;s creatures is the
white-tailed squirrel (<i>Sciurus Kaibabensis</i>)
which may ordinarily be seen flickering
through the forest near Jacobs Lake Ranger
Station. This is the most beautiful squirrel
in the Western Hemisphere, and one of the
rarest, for it lives nowhere else. It is about
the size of a large gray squirrel, though
shorter and stockier, is dark bluish gray
marked with brown, has long tufted ears
and a broad feathery tail that is almost
pure white. Cougars and mountain sheep
are rarely seen by the ordinary traveler.
Captain Dutton wrote of a visit to the
Kaibab in 1880: &ldquo;It is difficult to say precisely
wherein the charm of the sylvan
scenery of the Kaibab consists. We, who
through successive summers have wandered
through its forests and parks, have come to
regard it as the most enchanting region it
has been our privilege to visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a constant succession of parks
and glades&mdash;dreamy avenues of grass and
flowers winding between sylvan walls, or
spreading out in broad open meadows....
The balmy air, the dark and sombre spruces,
the pale-green aspens, the golden shafts of
sunshine shot through their foliage, the
velvet sward&mdash;surely this is the home of
the woodland nymphs.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c6">The North Rim of the Grand Canyon</h2>
<p>The Grand Canyon is the supreme epic
of erosion; there water has perpetuated its
sublimest masterpiece in stone. &ldquo;The Grand
Canyon fills me with awe,&rdquo; wrote Roosevelt.
&ldquo;It is beyond comparison&mdash;beyond
description; absolutely unparalleled
throughout the wide world.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wildness
so Godful, cosmic, primeval, bestows a
new sense of the earth&rsquo;s beauty and size,&rdquo;
said John Muir. &ldquo;By far the most sublime
of all earthly spectacles,&rdquo; is the
opinion of world travelers who have studied
its grandeur.</p>
<p>The Grand Canyon may be described as a
vast and intricate range of sunken mountains
cut through a hundred miles of high
plateau, &ldquo;a mountain chain reversed.&rdquo;
Usually it is pictured as a colossal chasm,
220 miles in length, a mile deep and some
twelve miles wide; but it is more precisely
a measureless labyrinth of canyons with an
infinite array of magnificent architectural
forms upthrust from their depths. Deep
down in the uttermost gorge of granite, the
Colorado, &ldquo;the rushingest, roaringest&rdquo;
river in the land, grinds ceaselessly at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
rocks. Numberless rich and vivid tones of
gray, green, blue, red and mauve tint its
mighty walls and temples, and, independent
of these, the sunlight pours daily into
the chasm a shifting color parade of exquisite
blues and purples, glowing reds and
golds.</p>
<p>Of the Kaibab division of the Grand
Canyon, Captain Dutton states: &ldquo;It is the
sublimest portion of the chasm, being nearly
a thousand feet deeper than any other, far
more diversified and complex and is adorned
with a multitude of magnificent features,
either wanting or much less strongly represented
elsewhere.&rdquo; According to the
<i>U. S. Geological Survey</i>, the Kaibab division is
from seven to fourteen miles wide and from
5,300 to 6,000 feet deep. The elevation of
the North Rim is from 8,000 to 9,000 feet
and it is eroded extensively into tremendous
lateral gorges and amphitheatres. The
North Rim has the incomparable Kaibab
Forest, uncounted unexplored cliff dwellings,
and a summer climate distinguished
by unfailingly cool nights. Along its
winding edge are a number of noted capes
and headlands that reveal some of the
grandest aspects of the Canyon.</p>

<p>Bright Angel Point stretches out between
the Transept and Bright Angel Canyon;
from its dizzy tip may be seen many of the
finest temples: Deva, Brahma, Zoroaster,
Wotan&rsquo;s Throne, Manu, Buddha, Isis,
Angels Gate and Cheops Pyramid. Near by
is a picturesque spring with a perfectly preserved
cliff dwelling adjacent. The Kaibab
Trail descends from the Point to the Suspension
Bridge across the Colorado River,
where it joins the Bright Angel Trail to
the South Rim.</p>
<p>Cape Royal, Cape Final and Point
Imperial are on the huge Walhalla Plateau
(locally called &ldquo;Greenland&rdquo;) southeast of
Bright Angel Camp, and each reveals panoramas
of greatest grandeur. Point
Imperial, the highest place on the Rim,
affords views of the Marble Canyon, Lee&rsquo;s
Ferry, Navajo Mountain and Houserock
Valley. The wonderful views from Cape
Royal extend west, south and east over the
templed gorge. On the way to Cape Royal
are Cliff Spring, many cliff dwelling ruins
and Angels Window.</p>
<p>Point Sublime, west of Bright Angel
Point, is another celebrated viewpoint,
esteemed by Dutton to surpass all others.
Thence may be seen the Hindu and Aztec
amphitheatres, Powell Plateau, the Dragon,
the Scorpion, and imperial Shiva, perhaps
the most magnificent of all the Canyon&rsquo;s
glorious temples.</p>
<p>Every visitor to the North Rim of Grand
Canyon should make the trip to Cape
Royal and Point Sublime.</p>

<h3 class="generic">From the North Rim of Grand Canyon to Bryce Canyon</h3>
<p>The route between Fredonia and the
North Rim has been described on the foregoing
pages. North of Fredonia the way
leads to Kanab, Utah, a thriving village at
the foot of the Vermilion Cliffs and 120
miles from the nearest railroad. Thence
it continues through the Vermilion Cliffs
by way of picturesque Three Lakes Canyon,
across dunes of pink sand, and down
to the canyon of the Parunuweap, cut
through the majestic White Cliffs. Splendid
panoramas of the temples and towers of
Zion are disclosed.</p>
<p>The highway follows Parunuweap River
through Long Valley to its source, passing
the Mormon villages, Mt. Carmel, Orderville
and Glendale. The regions traversed
are of unusual and unflagging scenic interest;
many of the rugged and tortuous side
canyons, which contain cliff dwellings,
give glimpses of impressive formations.</p>
<p>The traveler ascends the Terraced
Plateaus from the Shinarump and the Vermilion
to the Pink Cliffs, vivid exposures
of which, capped by lava, may be seen on
distant eminences. Chamberlain&rsquo;s Lake,
north of Glendale, is a deep, cold tarn fed
by a great spring. At Cedar Breaks Junction
the road crosses from the Colorado
drainage system into the Great Basin. The

<p>Very low round-trip Summer Excursion
Fares, with liberal limits and stop-over
privileges, are in effect during the season
to Cedar City and the scenic regions of
Southern Utah. Likewise, low side-trip excursion
fares to Cedar City and return are
available for Pacific Coast passengers traveling
via the Union Pacific System; $2.10
from Lund for those en route to or from
Southern California, and $13.75 from Salt
Lake City for those en route to San Francisco,
the Pacific Northwest or Yellowstone
Park, during the season.</p>
<p>From Cedar City the Utah Parks Company,
a subsidiary of the Union Pacific
System, operates on regular schedules during
the season a fleet of powerful eleven-passenger
automobiles of the latest and
most comfortable design to Zion National
Park, Cedar Breaks and Bryce Canyon
National Monument. Automobiles of the
Utah &amp; Grand Canyon Transportation
Company (operated independently), also
maintaining regular schedules, connect at
Zion Park and at Bryce Canyon for the
Kaibab Forest and the North Rim of Grand
Canyon. There are good roads, constantly
being improved, between Cedar City and
Zion National Park, Cedar Breaks and
Bryce Canyon National Monument; the
roads between Zion Canyon and Bryce
Canyon and the North Rim of Grand
Canyon are fair, safe to travel, and are also
undergoing improvement. Excellent lodges
and camps are maintained at places where
stop-overs are desirable.</p>
<p>The schedules of the automobiles, fares,
accommodation at lodges, etc., are shown
in detail on pages <a href="#Page_39">39</a> to <a href="#Page_43">43</a>. Advance
reservations made through any Union Pacific
representative listed on page <a href="#Page_47">47</a> will
insure accommodations in automobiles, as
well as at the lodges and camps. Inasmuch
as the trip to Zion, Bryce and the North
Rim of Grand Canyon is one of unusual
character, unlike, in fact, any other in the
United States, the traveler is urged to use
the services of a Union Pacific representative
in planning his itinerary. This may be
done by letter, telephone or personal call;
there is no charge for the service.</p>

<h3 class="generic">Season and Climate</h3>
<p>The season in Zion National Park is
from May 15 to October 15; at Bryce Canyon
and the North Rim of Grand Canyon
from June 1 to October 15. Dates of operation
and conditions are shown in connection
with all tours on pages <a href="#Page_39">39</a>-<a href="#Page_40">40</a>-<a href="#Page_41">41</a>.</p>
<p>The climate in Zion National Park is
mild throughout the season. At Bryce
Canyon and Cedar Breaks, farther north
and at higher elevations, cool weather may
be expected at night both early and late in
the season. In the Kaibab Forest and at
the North Rim of Grand Canyon, cool
nights are to be expected.</p>
<p>Southern Utah and Northern Arizona
are regions of clear, dry, sunny days,
delightfully exhilarating and followed by
refreshing nights. There are occasional
showers throughout the country during the
summer season.</p>
<h2 id="c8">Cedar City</h2>
<h3 class="generic">Gateway to Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon National Monument, Cedar Breaks, Kaibab Forest, North Rim Grand Canyon National Park</h3>
<p>All automobile tours start at Cedar City,
Utah, a prosperous and picturesque Mormon
city of 3,000 inhabitants, on the edge
of the Escalante Plain, at the foot of the
Markagunt Plateau, at an elevation of 5,750
feet. Coming from Lund, one may glimpse
in the distant east and nearly 5,000 feet
above him, some of the rosy palisades of
Cedar Breaks.</p>
<p>Cedar City has a good hotel, water
system, electric lights, a bank, photoplay
theatre, well stocked stores, hospital, Carnegie
Library, Mormon Tabernacle, a
branch of the State Agricultural College,
and a new and handsome railway station.
On the edge of the town is a band of Piute
Indians, the original inhabitants of the
country, who sell buckskin gloves, moccasins
and other articles. The prosperity of
Cedar City is derived from sheep, wool,
cattle, agriculture and the recent development
of vast deposits of iron in the Iron
Mountains, twelve miles away. The community,
founded by Mormon leaders in
1851, was named from the abundance of
cedar trees in the vicinity.</p>
<h4>El Escalante Hotel</h4>
<p>This handsome new Union Pacific hotel
at Cedar City would be an outstanding
establishment in a metropolis. It is a three-story
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
structure of cream brick with sweeping
wings and a broad verandah; seventy-five
guest rooms with tub and shower baths;
a spacious dining room; a banquet room,
ballroom, billiard room, barber shop, and
a luxurious lobby. The dining-room service
is of the highest metropolitan standard and
many delicacies from the local markets are
included in the menus. El Escalante Hotel,
named after Padre Sylvestre de Escalante,
the Spanish explorer-priest who was the
first white man to visit the region (1776),
is adjacent to the Union Pacific Station.
Reservations and arrangements for any automobile
tours may be made in the lobby.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><i>In the Kaibab National Forest</i></span></p>
</div>
<h4>Accommodations in Zion National Park</h4>
<p>The Utah Parks Company maintains in
Zion National Park, in a beautiful court
beside the Mukuntuweap River at the foot
of Red Arch Mountain and near the Great
White Throne, one of the finest viewpoints
in the Canyon, a handsome rustic Lodge
Center and forty-six double guest lodges,
accommodating 184 persons.</p>
<p>The Lodge Center is a two-story structure
of native pine, with foundations and
columns of rubble masonry. There is a
broad verandah, a spacious lobby and lounging
room, with a huge fireplace of rough
stone, Navajo rugs, a radio set, retiring
rooms and shower baths for men and women
on the main floor. The attractive and commodious
dining room, accommodating 100
guests, also with a fireplace, is on the
second floor.</p>
<p>Each room in the cosy double lodges of
native pine and fir is separate and private,
although two may be used en suite by
family parties. The rooms contain two
single beds or one double bed, a stove, dressing
table, chairs, rugs, and are lighted by
two double windows. All of the furnishings
are new and thoroughly comfortable
and the service is thoughtful and courteous.
The evening camp fire is a pleasing feature.
Zion Lodge is a delightful place to linger.</p>

</div>
<h4>What To Do in Zion&mdash;the Trails</h4>
<p>The visitor who merely rides in an automobile
to Zion Lodge and goes no farther
will obtain an entirely inadequate impression
of its beauty.</p>
<p>There are two trips that none should
miss. One is to the Narrows. An automobile
road extends to the Temple of
Sinawava, whence it is a walk of about
two miles; or, horses may be ridden all the
way from the Lodge, a distance of about
six miles. The other trip is up the spectacular
West Rim Trail either to the West
Rim, with a nine-mile loop on the crest (an
all-day trip) or to Angels Landing (a half-day
trip); the West Rim Trail is perhaps
one of the most scenic in the entire National
Park System. There is also a trail up
Cable Mountain to the East Rim, where
splendid panoramas are unfolded. The
trail up Lady Mountain, two miles in
length, has 1,400 steps chiseled from the
rock, two ladders and 2,000 feet of hand
cable. A short walk east from the Lodge
leads to a pretty waterfall and a rock-bound
pool. Other interesting little excursions
may be made and the guides will
gladly give suggestions.</p>
<h4>Accommodations at Bryce Canyon</h4>
<p>The Utah Parks Company maintains near
the rim of Bryce Canyon an attractive rustic
Lodge Center with a portico supported by
massive logs. Bryce Lodge Center contains
a hospitable lobby and lounge carpeted
with Navajo rugs, and with a fireplace, a
spacious dining room accommodating 100
guests, radio set, and retiring rooms and
shower baths for men and women on the
main floor.</p>
<p>In the pines adjacent to the Lodge Center
are forty-six double guest lodges of native
pine, accommodating 184 persons; each
chamber is separate and private although
they may be used en suite, if desired. Each
room contains two single beds or one
double bed, stove, dressing table, chairs,
rugs and two double windows, all new,
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
comfortable and kept in spotless condition.
Bryce Lodge is a short distance from the
rim of the Canyon at one of its most enchanting
viewpoints. There is a camp fire
gathering each night.</p>

&ldquo;Wylie&rdquo; Bright Angel Camp consisting
of a central dining tent and social room

hall, ten log cabins and a dormitory
accommodating seventy-five persons.
Wholesome food and clean quarters may
be had at V. T. Park Ranch, which is
under the management of W. S. Rust.</p>
<h3 class="generic">All-Expense Escorted Tours</h3>
<p>Two weeks special vacation tours of
Zion National Park, Cedar Breaks, Bryce
Canyon National Monument and Colorado
will leave Chicago every Saturday
commencing June 20th and continuing
through the season. These tours are at
moderate cost, are escorted by a courteous,
well-informed travel representative who
relieves you of all the details by arranging
for tickets, sleeping car and hotel reservations,
automobile transportation, baggage
transfers, sight-seeing guides, side-trips,
etc., leaving you free to sit back, relax,
and enjoy every minute of your vacation.</p>
<p>Similar tours are conducted to Yellowstone
National Park and to California.
Schedules permit each tour to be combined
with any other; travelers may select a
combination that appeals to individual

<h4>Cedar City As a Side Trip</h4>
<p>Holders of one-way or excursion tickets to Pacific
Coast, or to Yellowstone Park, via the Union Pacific
System, may obtain stopover at Salt Lake City, whence
a low side-trip excursion fare is in effect during the
season for Southern Utah visitors. Or if the through
ticket is to or from Southern California via Union
Pacific System, stopover may be made at Lund, Utah,
whence there is also a low side-trip excursion fare to
Cedar City, only thirty-two miles from Lund.</p>

<p>Baggage must not be checked beyond Cedar City.
The automobiles of the Utah Parks Co. will carry
not to exceed forty pounds of hand baggage free.</p>
<p>Storage charges will be waived on baggage left at
Union Pacific System stations, Salt Lake City, Ogden,
Lund, Cedar City, and Los Angeles, by passengers
making any of the tours of the Utah Parks Co. from
Cedar City.</p>
<h4>What To Wear</h4>
<p>Warm clothing should be worn and one should be
prepared for the sudden changes of temperature common
at elevations of from 8,000 to 9,000 feet. Medium
weight overcoats, jackets or sweaters should be taken.
Outing clothes, including riding breeches, stout shoes
and puttees, or boots, and serviceable gloves will add

<h4>Stratified Rocks of Cedar Breaks, Bryce Canyon, Zion Canyon, Grand Canyon and Intermediate Regions</h4>
<p>Rearranged and visualized principally from unpublished studies of Willis T. Lee,
by courtesy of the National Parks Association.</p>
<p>These strata presumably were once continuous over the entire Plateau Region and
the Grand Canyon. Many were much thicker than now, having been eroded during
long periods when the surface was temporarily lifted above sea level. Altogether
they may cover a creative period exceeding ninety million years. Strata are said to be
unconformable when they do not lie in regular, parallel sequence.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
